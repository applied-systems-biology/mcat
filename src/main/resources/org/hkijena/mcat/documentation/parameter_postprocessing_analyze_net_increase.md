Defines if all kinetic clusters with a signal net increase should be used for AUC calculation. 

If it is enabled, a weighted curve is calculated for each sample with the weights being the corresponding pixel abundance values for all kinetic clusters with a signal net increase. These curves are then normalized by the total number of pixels of the respective samples and the AUC is calculated, taking into account the cutoff value.
