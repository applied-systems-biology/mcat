Defines which part of the kinetic curves is used for calculation of area under the curve (AUC) statistics. 

This parameter can be set to a floating point number between 0 and 1 and controls which portion at the beginning of the curves is excluded from AUC calculation. If this parameter is set to 0, the whole curve is taken into account. If it is set to 0.5, the first half of the curve is omitted. This option can for example be useful to analyze initial dye uptake and dye excretion separately or to limit a study to certain phases of signal development.
