Defines how many kinetic cluster centers are extracted. 

This parameter controls how many clusters are used when performing k-means clustering. Smaller values can lead to bad approximation of the true kinetics present in the image, while larger values can lead to overfitting to confined regions with possibly strongly fluctuating signal intensities.
